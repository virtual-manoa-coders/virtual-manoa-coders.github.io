## Project Goal
<p> Our goal is to create an application where users can track their daily, weekly, monthly, or annual greenhouse emission, and how their data lines up with other people in the same area. </p>

## 01/21/2021
<p> We came up with a general goal and assignments for each team member. The assignment is as follows:</p>
<ul><li> Design & Mockup: Jiajun & Sophia </li>
  <li> Math function: Christian & Angela </li>
  <li> Database schema: Patima & Taylor </li>
  <li> Login & user account : Branden & Edwin </li></ul>
<p> Because some of these assignments are harder than the other, we do not have set dates for completion just yet. We want to get our feet wet and find out what we need as we go for now. </p>
